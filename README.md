# Welcome to the guts of my portfolio: iammattwalsh.com!

This portfolio is a living document designed to showcase some of my talents. It was originally written primarily in 2-3 days, followed by spurts of tinkering. 

In its current form it is written in only responsive semantic HTML and CSS. JavaScript may be added to display those abilities as well, but as of yet I have not encountered a need for it (and would prefer not to bloat the site just for bells and whistles).
