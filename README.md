# Welcome to the guts of my portfolio: iammattwalsh.com!

This portfolio is a living document designed to showcase some of my talents. It was originally written primarily in 2-3 days, followed by spurts of tinkering. 


In its current form it is primarily written in responsive semantic HTML and CSS. Vue.js was used for the project page. This could have been handled with vanilla JS, but as I typically use Vue.js for larger projects I chose to implement it here instead.
